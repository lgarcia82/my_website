This is a personal website built by me, Lee Garcia (el_g), strictly to promote myself professionally in the field of software development and computer science. It is still a work in progress, and is considered version 1

It was built with 
<span style="color:red">*HTML5*</span>, 
<span style="color:blue">*CSS3*</span> using 
<span style="color:pink">*SASS*</span>, and
<span style="color:yellow">*JavaScript*</span> . It is hosted via 
<span style="color:lightblue">**Netifly**</span>

Design for this site is heavily influenced by Brittany Chiang and it should be noted that I only take credit for the work put into the build and not the ideas used in the design :slightly_smiling_face:
