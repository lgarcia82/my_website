This is a personal website built by me, Lee Garcia (el_g), strictly to promote myself professionally in the field of software development and computer science. It is still a work in progress, and this should be considered version 1.

It was built with HTML5, CSS3 using (Sass), and JQuery. It is hosted by Netifly

Design for this site is heavily influenced by Brittany Chiang and it should be noted that I only take credit for the work put into the build and not the ideas used in the design :slightly_smiling_face:
